# Decoding Pandemic Patterns

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 dataset from John Hopkins University. The dataset includes data from 198 countries and regions from January 22, 2020, to the present. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and hypothesis testing.

## Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and merged data for countries with multiple regions to provide a single **time-series** for each country.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified trends and patterns in the progression of the pandemic, visualizing the data using Python libraries such as **pandas** and **matplotlib**.
- **Investigation of Confirmed Cases and Deaths**: Analyzed the number of confirmed cases and deaths in each country over time.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Few Results
- Countries that encountered lowest number of deaths
